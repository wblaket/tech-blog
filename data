Today\n            we're going to look at five great ways you can optimize your windows machine.`,\n\n            `1. Run Disk Clean-Up`,\n            `Disk Clean-up is a built-in tool that comes with your installation of Windows.\n            You can get to it by searching for \"Disk Clean-up\" in the Windows search bar.\n            This handy tool will scan your hard-drive for those pesky extra files in the background\n            of your computer that you don't need. It will even tell you how much disk space you'll get back -\n            you could potentially restore several GB's worth of storage!`,\n\n            `2. Remove Start Up Items`,\n            `Notice that your computer is booting up slowly? It could be because you have too many\n            programs that are instructed to automatically start when your computer turns on. If you launch\n            Task Manager and click the 'Start-Up' tab and see a list of programs that are set to start when you log in.\n            It will even tell you if it has a Low, Medium, or High impact on your computer's start-up performance.\n            If there's anything you don't need to start automatically, go ahead and right click to disable. You should notice\n            better performance.`,\n            `3. Uninstall Unnessiary Programs`,\n            `As the years go on it's easy to accumiliate many programs on your computer and forget about them later.\n            You will want to make a habit out of regularly taking inventory of your programs and uninstalling the ones\n            you no longer need. You can quickly do this by going to Apps & Features and uninstall any programs that may be\n            taking up too much space on your device.",
